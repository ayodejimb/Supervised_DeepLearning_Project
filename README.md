# Supervised Deep Learning Project

This repository contains my implementation in PyTorch to overcome the problem of overfitting when training a deep learning model on small data samples. I trained the model on only 5% of training data and achieved close performance as training the model on full training data. The aim of this project is to imagine cases of real world problems, such as in medical imaging domain where data labelling/annotations are very few or scarce.  

The implentation is contained in the notebook file (project_implementation.ipynb). The link to download the dataset is also contained in the file.
