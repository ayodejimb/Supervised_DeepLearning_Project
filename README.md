# Supervised DeepLearning Project

This repository contains my implementation in PyTorch to overcome the challenge of training a deep learning model on 5% of training data and achieve similar performance as training the model on full training data. The aim of the project is imagine cases of real world problems, such as in medical imaging domain where data labelling/annotations are very few or scarce.
